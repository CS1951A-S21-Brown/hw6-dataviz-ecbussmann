    <h2> Written questions
    </h2>
      <p>
      Question 1: My visualization addresses the number of titles per genre in a straightforward way, by
      presenting each genre in the dataset and the number of movies that were assigned that genre
      for at least one of their genres. The bar graph shows the exact number of movies per genre as well
      as the relative number, as indicated by bar length. It also shows the average runtime by year via
      a scatterplot, which nicely arranges the points in a chronological and temporally-intuitive manner.
      Finally, my visualization addresses the last question (top actor/director pairs by number of movies
      made together) by displaying the 15 most frequent pairs and the most frequent genre of movie they've
      made together. I expanded this by also adding the most frequent actors in the dataset and their most
      common movie genre.

      Question 2: D3 was helpful in this assignment because it allowed information to be expressed in multiple ways.
      For example, I could use color to show the relative frequency of titles per actor while also adding a
      tool-tip or axis to give the user the exact frequency value if they are interested. In this way, D3 can make
      the visualization intuitive and immediate and yet still precise. D3 was also helpful in making the visualization
      interactive (buttons, transition, tooltip), which both improved both the aesthetics and could help the viewer
      be more engaged in the data and explore it further. Finally, D3 was very useful in giving me a variety of
      different options for graph types, and making these graph types and inputs flexible to different JavaScript
      data types. For example, I used maps and lists as data structures because I had to do pre-processing and
      computation, and this worked just as well as the dataframes that we used in the lab.

      </p>
      <p>
      Question 3: D3 might not be the best tool for a visualization if the visualization or graph format is not
      well-supported by one of D3's existing graph types, such as bar graphs, scatter plots, etc. While this may
      be unlikely, in any case the person creating the visualization will have to adapt their visualization
      to the formats that D3 allows for. This tool might
      also not be the best choice if someone is looking for a quick, simple visualization of data that does
      not require in-depth interactives, as certain details such as page alignment/margins, axes, and labeling
      can be somewhat difficult or require more syntactical overhead to produce than a simple visualization
      using Excel, for example. Lastly, if someone wanted to utilize many external packages in doing their analysis
      or visualization, D3 might not be the best choice, and you might want to use a Python-supported visualization
      tool instead.

      Question 4: It is likely that users without visual impairs are most likely to find these visualizations most
      accessible. However, I tried to use some of the principles from the articles to make my design more accessible,
      including having informative titles, axes, and presenting information in more than one way (eg. having
      the bar length, bar color intensity, and frequency annotations all describe absolute and relative frequency).
      I could make this design even more accessible by adding a summary to the bottom of the charts (describing,
      for example, the overall trend of the graph or the greatest actor or actor-director duo). I could try
      applying different filters to make the colors more crisp/contrasted, and explore other ways to display the
      top genre than a hover tool, which may be difficult/impossible to see with assistive technology.

      </p>

      Question 5: Reflecting on my design process, I tried to think about certain aspects (eg. displaying information
      in multiple ways) from the very beginning. However, other aspects such as what information I would display on the
      screen versus in an interactive button/tooltip, I decided towards the middle or end of my process, once I saw
      how the data was distributed and which patterns would be the most interesting to explore. Not knowing the details
      of the data before I visualized it definitely played into potentially lower accessibility, as well as having a
      limited amount of time to complete the assignment and not knowing how to do things in D3. I was more often
      pre-occupied with basic visualization details relevant to all users
      (eg. how to make the axes appear correctly) which left less time for accessibility.
